## General info

  

I created an e-shop page and called it **TechWorld**.

  

- It shows two phones and two smart watches from the popular companies *Samsung* and *Apple*.

  

- Under the images of the devices there is a description in the form of a table:

<table>

<tr  class="table-title">

<td>Name</td>

<td>LED</td>

<td>Resolution</td>

<td>CPU</td>

<td>Memory</td>

<td>Waterproof</td>

<td>OS</td>

<td>Price</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>iPhone 14</td>

<td>OLED</td>

<td>2532 x 1170</td>

<td>A15 Bionic 6-core</td>

<td>256GB</td>

<td>IP68</td>

<td>iOS 16</td>

<td>1099€</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Galaxy S22</td>

<td>AMOLED</td>

<td>2340 x 1080</td>

<td>Exynos 2200 8-core</td>

<td>256GB</td>

<td>IP68</td>

<td>Android 12</td>

<td>949€</td>

</tr>

</table>

  

>Client can distinguish the properties of the two devices and decide which one is more suitable for him.

  

- At the bottom of the page is a [link](https://rostajecna.github.io/WAProject15.09/pages/newsletter.html) that takes the user to the newsletter:

```html

<p>
    <a  href="pages/newsletter.html">Subscribe to discounts and special offers</a>
</p>

```

>There he can choose the topic he is interested in and about which he wants to receive promotions as well as the latest news.
