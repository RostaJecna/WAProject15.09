## First exercise

I created an e-shop page and called it **TechWorld**. 

- It shows two phones and two smart watches from the popular companies *Samsung* and *Apple*. 

- Under the images of the devices there is a description in the form of a table:
<table>
    <tr class="table-title">
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>LED</td>
        <td>Resolution</td>
        <td>CPU</td>
        <td>Memory</td>
        <td>Waterproof</td>
        <td>OS</td>
        <td>Price</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>iPhone 14</td>
        <td>OLED</td>
        <td>2532 x 1170</td>
        <td>A15 Bionic 6-core</td>
        <td>256GB</td>
        <td>IP68</td>
        <td>iOS 16</td>
        <td>1099€</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Galaxy S22</td>
        <td>AMOLED</td>
        <td>2340 x 1080</td>
        <td>Exynos 2200 8-core</td>
        <td>256GB</td>
        <td>IP68</td>
        <td>Android 12</td>
        <td>949€</td>
    </tr>
</table>

>Client can distinguish the properties of the two devices and decide which one is more suitable for him.

- At the bottom of the page is a [link](https://rostajecna.github.io/WAProject15.09-1/pages/newsletter.html) that takes the user to the newsletter:
```html
<p>
  <a href="pages/newsletter.html">Subscribe to discounts and special offers</a>
</p>
```
>There he can choose the topic he is interested in and about which he wants to receive promotions as well as the latest news.
